# Escaping commoditization in music

I've been writing music since 2017, in various capacities.

There's nothing wrong with producing a commodity. Adding your voice to the tides of a shifting market and navigating an unforgiving industry can be exciting. Popularity is exciting. And whether or not you care about popularity, it's important to have a stable audience. 

But we all want to escape. All creators, at some level, share the quixotic belief that unique, irreplaceable qualities power our creative output. 

Uniqueness naturally leads to sameness.

There aren't many ways to escape the downward pressure of commoditization. Giving a unique product a receptive audience often results in a community producing permutations of the same original seed.
