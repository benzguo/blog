# Effortless Systems and the timeless way

*started 2019*

I've been thinking about the idea of "effortless systems" recently, mostly inspired by reading The Timeless Way of Building, and the idea that there are generalizable ways to build things that are simple, humane, and timeless.

> Each one of us has, somewhere in his heart, the dream to make a living world, a universe.


> Good systems guide you towards adding extra meaning without interrupting flow state.


> You can focus on each pattern by itself, one at a time, certain that those patterns which come later in the sequence will fit into the design which has evolved so far. You can pay full attention to each pattern; you can let it have its full intensity. Then you can give each pattern just that strange intensity which makes the pattern live.
​​
​​> Once you find the proper sequence, the power to design coherent things follows from it almost automatically, and you will be able to make a beautiful and whole design, without any trouble. If the sequence is correctly formed, you can create a beautiful whole, almost without trying, because it is in the nature of your mind to do so.

> A pattern only works, fully, when it deals with all the forces that are actually present in a situation. The difficulty is that we have no reliable way of knowing just exactly what the forces in a situation are.
​​
​​> The "bad" patterns are unable to contain the forces which occur in them.
​​
​​> The search for a name is a fundamental part of the process of inventing or discovering a pattern. So long as a pattern has a weak name, it means that it is not a clear concept.
​​
​​> Just as a great artist is one who observes very carefully the things which make the difference--so it does, indeed, take great powers of observation--great depth, great concentration, to formulate these simple rules.
​​
​​> It is because they are so ordinary, indeed, that they strike to the core. These deep things which really matter, they are not fragile--they are so solid that they can be talked about, expressed quite clearly.


​​On decisions and opinions:
​​
​​> The only way a pattern can help make a situation genuinely more alive is by recognizing all the forces which actually exist, and then finding a world in which these forces can slide past each other.
​​
​​On repair and growth
​​
​​> Several acts of building, each one done to repair and magnify the product of the previous acts, will slowly generate a larger and more complex whole than any single act can generate.
​​
​​> The love, and care and patience needed to bring every part into adjustment with the forces acting on it, can only exist when each detailed part is cared for, and shaped, by someone who has the time and patience and knowledge to understand the forces acting on it.
​​
​​> In a system which approaches the character of nature, the parts must be adapted with an almost infinite degree of subtlety: and this requires that the process of adaptation be going on through the system, constantly.
​​
​​> In order for the larger patterns to come into being from the aggregation of the smaller acts, it is necessary that each group is made responsible for helping the next larger group create the larger patterns which the larger group requires.



> All this has defined the task of creation, or design, as a huge task, in which something gigantic is brought to birth, suddenly, in a single act, whose inner workings cannot be explained, whose substance relies ultimately on the ego of the creator.
​​
​​> Imagine, by contrast, a system of simple rules, not complicated, patiently applied, until they gradually form a thing. Here there is no mastery of unnameable creative processes: only the patience of a craftsman, chipping away slowly; the mastery of what is made does not lie in the depths of some impenetrable ego; it lies, instead, in the simple mastery of the steps in the process, and in the definition of these steps.

> The individual buildings which you make, will live, or not, according to the depth and wholeness of the language which you use to make them with.
