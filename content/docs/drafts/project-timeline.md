​​Mac plotting software
​​I spent hours on lab computers (the candy colored round macs, from the age when the Mini Cooper was chic design) plotting 3D surfaces with some program
​​there was also that bug game, did that come pre-installed on macs?

​​TI-83
​​bouncing ball screensaver thing, never quite made it to pong
​​7th grade math class
​​how did I even program on a calculator
​​long lasting attachment to software on mobile devices
​​why don’t we do more programming on our phones today?
​​Mathematica
​​I had some light exposure to Mathematica in some high school math class, but don’t remember much of it
​​I think it was pretty guided/enclosed, not very exploratory
​​AP CS
​​I remember writing a Pac-Man game in Java, but don’t remember much else
​​Max-MSP
​​I was exposed to the idea of Max early on, in middle school, from being a Radiohead/Jonny Greenwood fanboy
​​I first tried Max in high school (late senior year) but I didn’t spend much time with it. I’d end up revisiting it in college.
​​I got deeper exposure to Max in an electro acoustic music class - the professor had a gigantic Max project that
​​C++, audio, hardware
​​This was pretty intense
​​I was working with a windows SDK for a cochlear implant (what was the brand), with only paper documentation in a gigantic terrifying binder (and CD-distributed software). The initial learning curve was the steepest I’ve been on, and I’m still amazed to this day that I got anything to compile. I’m pretty sure I didn’t know about version control at this point.
​​I had to play audio (simple synthesis, sine waves and filtered noise). I had to use C++, and Visual Studio, back when Visual Studio was a much more overwhelming IDE
​​I remember using PortAudio, looking into Qt, and mostly using JUCE (which is now owned by Roli?)
​​Microsoft Access
​​I had to do some data entry in Microsoft Access, and I think I configured some UI
​​Remember when being a database administrator/thing was a thing? I think I was basically doing the entry level version of that.
​​Matlab
​​I also remember helping out with some Matlab projects - I think the lab used Matlab to run psychoacoustic experiments (simple stimuli-response loop stuff). I vaguely remember building a generic grid of buttons that played sounds, and in retrospect this vaguely resembled a pad-controller, like the MPC. I don’t think I knew much about electronic music and hardware like the MPC at the time.
​​iOS - Vowel synth
​​At some point in my lab work I had to figure out how to write a filter
​​I discovered RBJ’s DSP cookbook, and wrote/cargo-culted a decent set of simple filters
​​I was learning about audio perception, vocal synthesis, and decided somehow to put it all together into an iOS app. I don’t know what drew me to iOS development, or what drew me in. Probably downloading apps. I think it was SMULE and other audio apps.
​​CS education
​​I went back to college and decided to take more CS classes
​​Mostly problem sets, but built some things. I think the largest was a spam filter, in Ocaml
​​Tomb raider geocaching
​​I did a throwaway-project internship building a tomb raider geocaching app, using Parse as a backend. It was silly, but I learned more iOS skills
​​3D compass
​​Why does your phone have to be horizontal for the compass to work? Maps apps and the Compass app work more like this now, but I wanted to build a simple navigation app where a big 3D arrow would point towards your destination
​​got some GL experience
​​Flocking birds 3D audio
​​I used OpenFrameworks
​​discovered this first in Processing, a flocking simulation
​​wanted to combine that with audio - what if each bird emitted a different pitched sine wave, and you could capture the sound of the flock going past you
​​Bayan
​​QWERTY keyboard browser synth
​​Linode, Django
​​I was looking for programming experience during the school year, and found myself employed by some washed up alum 
​​I don’t remember what the app idea was - there were probably a few
​​I was also pretty in over my head, I had to get access to a Linode server and it was my first encounter with a large foreign codebase
​​Python
​​I wrote some python scripts to draw procedural lines based on some input parameters, for a composer
​​Venmo iOS app
​​I was part of the iOS 6/7 redesign
​​I got really into form validation for the signup page, which clued me into reactive programming. This was early days for Rx and stuff like Elm. 
​​Has anyone done a history of reactive popularity? Would be interesting
​​Venmo iOS SDK
​​I turned a redirect only SDK into an SDK that actually interacted with the Venmo API
​​This also involved factoring out a networking library  as a shared dependency between the app and SDK
​​D3 graph viz notes
​​I spent a Christmas holiday fiddling with D3, prototyping a note-taking interface based on the bouncy force directed graph viz
​​one of my blocks still gets emails to me occasionally from people who think they need to ask permission to use it (maybe it needs a license)
​​I started admiring Mike Bostock, who has since ascended at the NYT and now started a cool new thing
​​this was kind of like Roam, or mind map software like Omnigraffle
​​Unity game
​​I was inspired by Fez and other puzzle games (sausage roll, English country tune, monument valley)
​​Game prototype where you’re a cube and solve puzzles that involve changing the direction of gravity to navigate between platforms and push stuff around
​​I was into indie games, and following some of the app success stories like Zach Gage
​​Mike Lazerwalker has gone pretty far here, cool to see
​​Sum app
​​Reactive cocoa
​​hardware but didn’t do too much
​​crazy bubble animation
​​Charting library
​​chartbeat
​​Glitch Text
​​Emoji are going to be big
​​Zalgo and Unicode are full of treasures
​​Could’ve been a good custom keyboard 
​​MusicKit
​​Swift music theory library
​​mostly an exercise to learn swift
​​Taptone
​​Send push notification melodies to your friends
​​I think I used Parse for auth and notifications
​​Stripe Dashboard iOS
​​Stripe API bindings, inspired by Chris Eidhof
​​Andy Matuschak did an influential WWDC talk, and then I got to see him speak at FuncSwiftConf. Cool to see how far he’s gone
​​Router refactor
​​MIDI transformer
​​Mac app to harmonize or transform midi input, used with a DAW 
​​Magnify
​​Spotify & SoundCloud play repeater, Mac app
​​Stripe iOS SDK
​​Prebuilt UI
​​Stripe Terminal
​​Built the iOS SDK, designed the product
​​Managed some teams
​​Funnel alerts for OODA loop
​​Filmbot
​​Initially a mailing list
​​Now a cron static site
​​scraping
​​Manypad
​​Cross-platform no-coding app development, with a WYSIWG grid interface, built in Flutter
​​somewhere between Squarespace and Glide app
​​too ambitious
​​emvspecs.info
​​Static site
​​fits a very niche need
​​coread
​​I started using pinboard and was amazed by the opinionated minimal character of the product
